[Device42](http://www.device42.com/) is a Continuous Discovery software for your IT Infrastructure. It helps you automatically maintain an up-to-date inventory of your physical, virtual, and cloud servers and containers, network components, software/services/applications, and their inter-relationships and inter-dependencies.


This repository contains script that helps you sync data between Samanage and Device42 back and forth.

### Download and Installation
-----------------------------
    To utilize the samanage_device42_mapping script, Python 3.5+ is required. The following Python Packages are required as well:

    * certifi==2017.11.5
    * chardet==3.0.4
    * idna==2.6
    * requests==2.20.0
    * urllib3==1.24.2
    * salesforce-bulk==2.1.0
    * simple-salesforce==0.73.0
    * six==1.11.0
    * unicodecsv==0.14.1

    These can all be installed by running “pip install -r requirements.txt”.

    Once installed, the script itself is run by this command: "python sync.py".

### Configuration
-----------------------------
    Prior to using the script, it must be configured to connect to your Device42 instance and your Samanage instance. 
    * Save a copy of mapping.xml.sample as mapping.xml. 
    * Enter your URL, Users and Passwords in the Samanage and Device42 sections (lines 5-11). 
    
    Below the credential settings, you’ll see a Tasks section. 
    Multiple Tasks can be setup to synchronize various CIs from Device42 to Samanage. 
    In the <api> section of each task, there will be a <resource> section that queries Device42 to obtain the desired CIs. 
    Full documentation of the Device42 API and endpoints is available at https://api.device42.com. 
    Individual tasks within a mapping.xml file can be enabled or disabled at will by changing the enable=”true” to enable=”false” in the <task> section.

    Once the Device42 API resource and the <mapping> section is where fields from Device42 (the “resource” value) can be mapped to fields in Samanage (the “target” value). 

    After configuring the fields to map as needed, the script should be ready to run. 

### Compatibility

    * Script runs on Linux and Windows

### Info
